# raspi3-tutorial-build-tool-scripts
Scripts to create the build tools necessary for the raspi3-tutorial repo: [`bztsrc`](https://github.com/bztsrc)/[**`raspi3-tutorial`**](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial)

These scripts simply replicate the steps (and commands) in the first part of the tutorial, [AArch64 Cross Compiler](https://github.com/bztsrc/raspi3-tutorial/tree/master/00_crosscompiler)

Run these scripts with  `sh -x`, for example

```none
aa_01_get_sources.sh
```
if you so desire... or you could make them executable... up to you.

You can run each of them individually, one at a time, or use the umbrella script `aa_00_run_all.sh` to run the whole lot in one go (which make time some time).
